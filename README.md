Synapse's Ace Editor straight up stolen from synapse x and then very slightly modified with its own sh*tty theme and font, added some more autocompletion in a bad way but whatever

i didnt create this, all credits goes to [ajaxorg's ace editor](https://ace.c9.io) and the rest of the credits goes to synapse x for doing their thing on it idk what they did but they did
